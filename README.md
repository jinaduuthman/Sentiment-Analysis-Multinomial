# Sentiment-Analysis-Multinomial
A Bayesian classifier is a wonderful thing: given an input, you get a probability for every possible output. A naive Bayesian classifier makes the simplifying assumption that every dimension of the input vector is independent.

In this exercise, you will use a naive Bayesian classifier to classify a tweet using the ”Bag of Words” approach.
I’ve supplied you with a collection of tweets to airlines that have been labeled ”positive”, ”negative”, or ”neutral”. You will develop a system that will be able to label the sentiment of a tweet with about 80% accuracy.
